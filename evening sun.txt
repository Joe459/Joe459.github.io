My God’s mercy knows no bounds

Beauty is in His creation 

There is nothing new under the sun

But every warm breeze is so precious



God lets tides pass within me

God let love flow out from me

I see Him in everything

I see Him in everything



My God’s mercy has no limit

I am forever indebted 

Who are You, most Holy source of all things

I cannot comprehend Your all-encompassing being



God sets up a guide post within me

made from a tree blessed by the evening sun

God let love flow out from me

I see Him in everything

I see Him in everything
