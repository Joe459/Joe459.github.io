I am unmoored, God
I am unmoored

I can swing
I can swivel frantically

The thread connecting me to You is thin and taught

I am unmoored, God
I am unmoored

I can land 
I can crash violently

The thread connecting me to You is straight and thin

I am unmoored, God
I am unmoored

I can illuminate
I can burn blindingly

The thread connecting me to You in thin and straight

I am unmoored, God
I am unmoored

I can rest
I can disassemble completely

The thread connecting me to You is taught and straight

I am unmoored, unmoored, unmoored
I am unmoored, unmoored, unmoored

Praise God, Praise God, crying Praise God

I am unmoored

Anchor, anchor, my anchor

Praise God, Praise God, crying Praise God
