How do I describe you to them?

What words can I utter?

The cup that is my soul is spilling over -

Who is there to soak up the spilling?


At night a table is set with white cloth and shining silver and dark blood.


With reverence and focus I can drive a thin shining rod through it.


“God forgive and help me”


The great temperer has made me into a tuning fork to be played with all the silver cups and dishes.


How do I serve half of my heart on a plate?

How do I lift a heavy truth onto the table?

Can my jaw drop to the floor?

Will I then be able to speak my truth?


The thin shining rod is true and held by my fingertips.


“Praise God”


The dishes vibrate violently with me. Blood pours out of the table.
