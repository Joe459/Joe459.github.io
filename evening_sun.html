My God’s mercy knows no bounds
<br>
<br>
Beauty is in His creation 
<br>
<br>
There is nothing new under the sun
<br>
<br>
But every warm breeze is so precious
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

God lets tides pass within me
<br>
<br>
God let love flow out from me
<br>
<br>
I see Him in everything
<br>
<br>
I see Him in everything
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

My God’s mercy has no limit
<br>
<br>
I am forever indebted 
<br>
<br>
Who are You, most Holy source of all things
<br>
<br>
I cannot comprehend Your all-encompassing being
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

God sets up a guide post within me
<br>
<br>
made from a tree blessed by the evening sun
<br>
<br>
God let love flow out from me
<br>
<br>
I see Him in everything
<br>
<br>
I see Him in everything
<br>
