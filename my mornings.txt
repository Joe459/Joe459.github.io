“My mornings are cursed”

I want to vomit my transgressions up

These are yours, but I want them

I play with the vomit

I can’t bear to say “I am saved”

I’m a dog

My idle mind

I read with evil intent - a grudge


Lord God is testing me, and because of this I am blessed

And because of this, I can forgive but not forget

And because of this, I will rest in You

God forgive me
